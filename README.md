A Simple WebCrawler

This project can be implented in any language. If the language changes at any time the project must stay consistent.

Project Description:
  - Search webpages for key words and store relevant information
    - Key words can be defined before hand
  - When branching to new sites, don't visit sites that have already been visited and only visit sites that have a potential for additional information. Ex. Image pages probably don't have additional information. 
  
Relevant information is not defined yet. For now, just store the keywords, what website they came from and the date.

Questions about major changes or project goals should be created in a sperate thread to maintain documentation of important events. Otherwise you are welcome to direct questions to Jake Roemer: tuc42833@temple.edu or anyone else.
